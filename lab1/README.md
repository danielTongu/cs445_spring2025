# Wine Quality Data Visualization

This project explores and visualizes the **Red Wine Quality dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) using Python and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Objective

The goal is to use real-world data to create meaningful visualizations and interpret relationships between wine features and quality scores. This assignment reinforces data handling, graphing skills, and visual storytelling with matplotlib.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name**: Wine Quality – Red Wine
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Description**: The dataset contains physicochemical properties of red wine samples (e.g., alcohol, pH, sugar) along with a quality score (rated 0–10 by wine testers).

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (3.7+ recommended).
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas
   ```
3. Download the `winequality` dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook WineQuality_Visualization.ipynb
   ```
5. Run each cell to view the visualizations and explanations.

## 📈 Visualizations

This notebook includes the following charts:

| Chart Type   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Bar Chart** | Distribution of wine quality ratings |
| **Line Graph** | Average quality vs. alcohol content |
| **Pie Chart** | Proportion of each wine quality score |
| **Box Plot** | Distribution of residual sugar |

Each chart is saved as an image in the format: `DanielTongu_<ChartTitle>.png`.
